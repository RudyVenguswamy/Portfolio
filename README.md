# Portfolio
### Welcome to my portfolio! Thanks for stopping by!

On this page you can find links to my independent data science projects. They focus on the areas that I'm passionate about: Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Social Impact, specifically air pollution. 

For my recommendation of what to look at depending on your interest:
- `SQL: Report on FordGo Bikes`
- `Data Visualization & Analysis: Visualizing Air Pollution`
- `Hardcore Machine Learning: Improving_ResNet_ComputerVision_DeepNetwork`
- `Data Science Philosophy: Monte_Carlo_For_Pi`

Instructions on Viewing:
Github has had challenges with rendering Jupyter Notebooks recently. If a notebook does not load for you, paste the URL for the project into the search bar at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to view that notebook. 

For example, pasting the ID for my ResNet Notebook takes you to:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RudyVenguswamy/Portfolio/blob/master/Improving_ResNet_ComputerVision_DeepNetwork.ipynb

Unfortunately you won't find my Event Search for Amazon Alexa, Deep Network Research or Dark Matter Detection work on here, as those are in private team repos. If you're interested in hearing more about those projects though, please feel free to get in contact with me at _rudyvenguswamy@berkeley.edu_!
