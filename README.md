# Portfolio
### Welcome to my portfolio! Thanks for stopping by!

On this page you can find links to my independent data science projects. They focus on the areas that I'm passionate about: Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and Social Impact, specifically air pollution. 

For my recommendation of what to look at depending on your interest:
- `SQL: Report on FordGo Bikes`
- `Data Visualization & Analysis: Visualizing Air Pollution`
- `Hardcore Machine Learning: Improving_ResNet_ComputerVision_DeepNetwork`
- `Interpretting Data Science: How Do You Present to Managers? (Technique Overview)`

Unfortunately you won't find my Event Search for Amazon Alexa, Deep Network Research or Dark Matter Detection work on here, as those are in private team repos. If you're interested in hearing more about those projects though, please feel free to get in contact with me at _rudyvenguswamy@berkeley.edu_!
